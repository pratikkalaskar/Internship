    <h2>At the Head of the “Class” CSS Assignment </h2>
    <section>
        <img src="TnJ.jpg" alt="">
        <p><i>You’ve learned how to style different elements using a class. This is noted in the style 
        sheet with a period in front of it and is called up by spacing once inside an element and 
        typing class=”classname”. You can name a class whatever you want (no spaces or 
        punctuation), but for it to work, you must be sure the class is in the CSS as indicated.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>For this assignment— </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In your classsite folder, create a new folder called c1. </li>
            <li>In c1, create three files—two HTML files and a CSS file. You will put all CSS in the 
                external stylesheet (not yet) and NOT on the HTML file. Save the HTML file as 
                coolclass1.html
                and coolclass2.html
                and the css as cool.css
                . </li>
            <li>Change the page title for both html files to be:
                <br> 
                coolclass1.html title--   First off, I am cool! By Your Name 
                <br>
                coolclass2.html title--   Secondly, I rock! By Your Name </li>
            <li>In the head, link
                both files appropriately so they will use the cool.css style sheet (HINT: link the relationship and include the 
                type and reference) </li>
            <li>You will make up your own information (words) and it must be error-free in spelling and grammar. The general theme is 
                coolness…so go with it (you can even get your information from the internet, copy/paste, etc., but edit and be sure it is 
                error-free and appropriate!) </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>coolclass1.html should have an h1 heading, a paragraph, a line, and h2 heading, a paragraph, another h2 heading, 
                        a paragraph, a line, and then a paragraph with a link to coolclass2.html </li>
                    <li>coolclass2.html should have an h2 heading, a paragraph, an h3 heading, a paragraph, another h3 heading, a 
                        paragraph, a line, and a h2 heading that reads These Are Cool… then a numbered list of your top five best cool 
                        things. After that, another paragraph that includes a link back to the home page (coolclass1.html).  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Once all your pages are created, THEN work on the style sheet. You must style as follows: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Default/body:  Arial font family, size 14, navy blue text with pale pink background </li>
                    <li>h1, h2, h3:  All should be Arial Black with Arial as the backup font; letters should be kerned (spaced) 3 pixels; text 
                        should have both an overline and an underline </li>
                    <li>h1 should be centered and all capitals (uppercase) </li>
                    <li>hot class should be created that uses letter kerning of 6 pixels, hot pink text, italics, and yellow background</li>
                    <li>cold class should be created that uses bold, bright blue text and pale blue background with a kerning of 20px and 
                        set to centered </li>
                    <li>Lines/rules should be set to have a color set to red and height of 5 px</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Apply the classes </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply the .hot class to the last h2 heading on coolclass1.html </li>
                    <li>Apply the .cold class to the first heading (h2) on coolclass2.html </li>
                    <li>Apply the .hot class to the final paragraph (the one after the list) on coolclass2.html</li>
                </ul>
                <li>On the stylesheet, comment out at the bottom (just follow the format at the top of a new CSS document-- /* words */)
                    Stylesheet created by your Name (so you will know it belongs to you when you print it) </li>
                <li>Preview everything in Internet Explorer and check to be sure everything is showing up properly (especially look for the 
                    under/overlines that don’t appear in Dreamweaver and verify that links are working) </li>
                <li>Print the CSS style sheet 
                    and the codes from coolclass2.html
                    ONLY. (2 printouts) </li>
                <li>Call me over for a screencheck (scoring guide is on the back of this sheet); have the first page open in IE and be ready to 
                    click the hyperlink when asked.  </li>
                <li>Put completed scoring guide with attachments in the tray! </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="foot">So, are you CLASSY? ☺ </p>
